# Linux Programming Interface 

## Reason 
The reason for the creation of this project is that I want to document the system calls, library functions and other low level interfaces that Linux provide as well as see if I can achieve the same functionality using golang language. 

* I will learn about how the low level functions and calls work in Linux, 
* See if I can find libraries in golang to accomplish the same or if there is a possibility to create a utility.
